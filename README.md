# Kitchen UP

It's a place where you can share and find recipes, and get inspired for your next cooking adventure. Imagine finding great meal ideas and easily inviting your friends to join in. With KitchenUp, cooking is not just a task, but a shared experience that brings joy back into your kitchen!

Kitchen Up is React-based application with express server on the backend. We utilized Sendgrip and Spoonacular API for some of the functionality. The best feature is using web sockets for bi-directional communication for cooking sessions.
